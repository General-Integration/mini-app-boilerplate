## Mini App Boilerplate

Project structure for mini app with sample `$bridge` methods

### Important Notes

- This project is running on Vue 3 composition API
- Use Vue CLI since [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) does not support file protocol (for now) so we cannot run index.html file directly from dist folder
- Use [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html) store for data centralize
